# Human Activity Classification Using the Smartphone Gyroscope Sensor Data

In this project, I've designed and implemented a mathematical model for the classification of human activities using smartphone Gyroscope sensor data. Specifically, a variety of features including the Pearson correlation, Chi-squared score, Anova F-value, and Mutual Information have been extracted from the raw sensor data and then a Random Forrest classification model has been applied to the data. Moreover, backward feature elimination using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with L-1 shrinkage has been implemented for improving the accuracy. The code has been written entirely in Python.
